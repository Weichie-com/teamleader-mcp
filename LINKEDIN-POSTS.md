🚀 **Just open-sourced: Teamleader MCP Server**

We built a bridge between AI assistants and Teamleader Focus.

Now you can:
→ "Find all open deals for Acme Corp"
→ "Create an invoice for 20 hours of consulting"
→ "Schedule a meeting with Sarah from TechStart"

No code. Just conversation.

42 tools covering contacts, companies, deals, invoices, quotations, time tracking, and more.

Works with Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible AI.

🛠️ **How we built an AI-native integration for Teamleader Focus**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is changing how AI assistants interact with business tools.

Instead of building chatbots or custom integrations, MCP lets AI assistants directly call APIs through a standardized protocol.

We just released an open-source MCP server for Teamleader Focus that exposes **42 tools** across:

📋 **CRM:** Contacts, Companies, Deals
💰 **Finance:** Invoices, Quotations, Payments  
📦 **Catalog:** Products
⏱️ **Operations:** Time Tracking, Calendar Events
📧 **Communication:** Email Tracking

**Technical highlights:**

✅ Full OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh
✅ Proper error handling and rate limiting
✅ TypeScript with full type safety
✅ Works with Claude Desktop out of the box
✅ Extensible architecture for custom tools

**The real magic?**

When you ask Claude: *"Create an invoice for DataFlow Solutions: 20 hours at €125/hour"*

It automatically:
1. Finds the company
2. Creates grouped line items
3. Calculates totals
4. Drafts the invoice

One sentence. Multiple API calls. Zero friction.

## Post 3: Use-Case Focused

**Best for:** Business audience, practical value

---

💡 **"I spent 2 hours on admin this morning"**

Every agency owner, freelancer, and small business has said this.

Logging time. Creating invoices. Updating deal stages. Scheduling follow-ups.

It's necessary. But it's not why you started your business.

**What if admin just... happened?**

We open-sourced an integration between AI assistants and Teamleader Focus.

Here's what it looks like in practice:

---

**End of client call:**
*"Log 45 minutes to the Acme project, description: discovery call about Q2 requirements"*

✅ Time tracked.

---

**Deal closed:**
*"Mark the DataFlow website deal as won, draft the first milestone invoice for €5,000, and schedule a kickoff meeting with their contact for next Monday"*

✅ Deal updated.
✅ Invoice drafted.
✅ Meeting scheduled.

---

**Quick lookup:**
*"What's the total value of open deals this quarter?"*

✅ Instant answer. No reports to run.

---

This isn't the future. It's available now.

The Teamleader MCP server works with Claude Desktop and is completely free and open source.

Because your expertise should go into the work, not the admin around it.
